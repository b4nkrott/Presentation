    " # Protein Thermophilicity Prediction\n",
    "by Daniel Huertas, Jona Rott, Paulina Luquin, Xiaomeng Xu \n",
    "\n",
    "##  Problem Formulation\n",
    "Thermostable proteins are able to withstand higher temperatures keeping their structure thus can be used for enzyme engineering to potentially accelerate chemical reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work we want to implement different machine learning models to build a predictive model to identify thermophilic and non-thermophilic proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dataset found in \"protein data.csv\" contains over 4,500 proteins (samples) and around 1,000 physicochemical and structural measurements calculated from the protein sequence (features). The first row is a header containing the names of all descriptors, these are shown in the table 1 from the file named \"ExamProject.pdf\".\n",
    "2. The data found in \"thermophilicity labels.csv\" contains the labels for the proteins. The first column is the ID of the protein and the second column is the label (1 for thermophilic, 0 for non-thermophilic).\n",
    "3. The dataset to evaluate the predictions of the model by submitting the predictions to the AI leaderboard (true labels are hidden) is in the file \"unknown protein data.csv\", the file has the same data format as the original \"protein data.csv\".\n",
    "4. The demo file \"random predictions.csv\" has the data format for the leaderboard submission: no header, the first column is the protein id and the second column is the prediction, with comma seperated columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents:\n",
    "The structure of the project is shown below in the contents of this file, here you can find the stages that were followed in order to build the classification model.\n",
    "0. Library Importation & Settings \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preparation: Importing & Matching Data \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Pre-Processing: Apply pre-processing steps to the training and testing datasets separately in order to avoid data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modeling:\n",

    "## 3. Modeling:\n",
    "To prevent inbalances in the train- test split of the data, for each model K-Fold cross validation is implemented, K was chosen depending on the computational complexity of each model. The models were imputed using the mean values and then normalized with the scaler function. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to effectively reduce the dimensionality of our dataset, thereby extracting and emphasizing the most relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning is done within the gridsearch method with the MCC metric for scoring. The preprocessing is done within each fold to prevent data-leakage. The optimal hyperparameters are determined with a grid-search. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the predictions on test data are performed once per fold and the metrics are calculated accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using the most common parameters identified during the grid-search, a final model is fit on the whole dataset to predict the thermophilicity of proteins in a unseen dataset. \n",
